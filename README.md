# School District Analysis using Pandas

### Introduction

Our client, Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district. We have been contacted to assist with preparing all test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns within the various schools within the district.  The overall task we have been hired for is to aggregate the data and show trends in school performance.

### Data Analysis

##### Data

We recieved two csv files to begin analysis, one of which contains personal identifying student information and grades and the other which contains information about the schools within the district. Due to FERPA, no individual student name will be associated with any individual student grade in this report for the privacy of the student. Each individual student is listed with their current grade, current school, and current scores in reading and math. All schools included are high schools, so only grades 9 through 12 are in this analysis. Overall there are 39170 students within the school district at the high school level split between 15 high schools within the district.
